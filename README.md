This project analyzes consumer complaints related to financial products and services for Bank of America, spanning the years 2017 to 2023. The dataset includes information such as:

The date complaints were submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
Dates the complaints were sent to the company for resolution.
The products and issues involved in the complaints.
The company's responses and whether they were timely.
By leveraging Power BI for visualization and analysis, the project aims to uncover trends and patterns that can inform better consumer service strategies and company operations.
